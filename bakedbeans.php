				<p>Most commercial canned baked beans are made from haricot beans,
				 also known as navy beans â€“ a variety of Phaseolus vulgaris in a sauce.
				  In Ireland and the United Kingdom, a tomato and sugar sauce is most commonly used,
				   and they are commonly eaten on toast or as part of a full English breakfast.
				  <br>
				The dish of baked beans is commonly described as having a savory-sweet flavor
				 and a brownish or reddish tinted white bean once baked, stewed, canned or otherwise cooked.</p>
