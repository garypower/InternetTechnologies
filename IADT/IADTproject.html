            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I set about creating an iPod DJ Mixer that would be useful for the ordinary individual to share the contents of their iPod. The main aim of the design was to make a unit that would be easy-to-use and affordable.  The DJ Mixer would be plugged into existing speakers and the further aim was to prevent the ‘clicks and pops’ usually associated with this type of connection. The entire unit would have to be created by myself and built within the year of DMT. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> All the designs and soldering work had to be completed by myself. The design allowed for two iPods to be mixed together with a DJ microphone in the mix when required. Also included was a Protection circuit provides security for the users so that any signal will be below the maximum operating voltage of the connected speakers and a tone control circuit that attenuates or amplifies the signal spectrum to a desirable level for the listener. The output from the mixer was a standard 1/4 inch stereo jack.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A tone control circuit is an electronic circuit used to modify an audio signal before it is fed to speakers, headphones or recording devices by way of an amplifier. Such circuits consist of a network of high-pass, low-pass, and/or band-pass filters. In their most basic form, they attenuate the high or low frequencies of the signal. Tone control circuits exist for many reasons. One is to allow listeners of recorded or broadcast music to adjust the sound to their liking. The adjustment may be necessary as a result of recording deficiencies, hearing deficiencies, listening room acoustics or playback equipment deficiencies.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When pink noise is sent through, as a reference signal, all the frequencies are present. By using my Tone Control I should be able to push certain levels of the frequency response. Pictured is the result for the mid-range push. The iPod DJ mixer performed as expected and passed all tests.</p>
